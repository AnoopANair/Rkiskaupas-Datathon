# Rkiskaupas-Datathon

## we will create a model to better utalize the snow clearing assets that the state has at its dispossal. 

## The plan is to utilize, traffic data (From the datasets provided) and real time sensor data (from the iceweather module an unofficial api for vedur.is) to find the optimal snow clearing path. This would enable the authorities associated with snow-clearing to open roads and re-route traffic in the most optimal way possible.
